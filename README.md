# DATA/PHYS3888‚ÄîDesigning a Morse Code Interpreter  with  Blink Recognition
This project is for  Morse CodeInterpreter. Author is **Barin_2**.

## Project Brief
Morse code is the easiest way for humans to convey information. The purpose of the 
project is to identify and classify three different blinks: Noramal 
Blink, Double Blink, and Long Blink  to distinguish analog **Dot (.)**, **Dash (_)** 
and **Break** To achieve closer communication between patients with generalized paralysis and nurses.
